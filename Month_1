 Week 1

1️⃣ Objective

The objective of Week 1 was to understand the fundamentals of Python programming and develop basic problem-solving skills using Python.

2️⃣ Concepts Learned
🔹 1. Variables

Variables are used to store data values in Python.
Example:

name = "Snehal"
age = 21
🔹 2. Data Types

Python supports different types of data:

Integer (int) → 10

Float → 10.5

String → "Hello"

Boolean → True / False

Example:

a = 10
b = 5.5
c = "Python"
d = True
🔹 3. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables.

Arithmetic Operators:

(Addition)

(Subtraction)

(Multiplication)

/ (Division)

% (Modulus)

🔹 4. Input and Output

The input() function is used to take user input and print() is used to display output.

Example:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)


🔹 5. Conditional Statements (if-else)

Used to make decisions in programs.

Example:

num = 10
if num > 5:
    print("Number is greater than 5")
else:
    print("Number is smaller")
🔹 6. Loops
For Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
While Loop

Used when the number of iterations is unknown.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


--------------------------------------------------------
 Learning Outcome

By completing Week 1:

I understood Python syntax and basic structure.

I learned how to use variables and data types.

I practiced decision-making using conditional statements.

I implemented loops for repetition.

I created simple real-world programs.

I developed a basic data processing script.

Week 1 helped me build a strong foundation in Python programming, which will be useful for data analysis and future projects.

## Month 1 – Data Structures and Functions

### 👩‍💻 Student Name: Snehal Badakh

### 📅 Week: 2

### 📚 Topic: Data Structures and Functions

---

# 1️⃣ Objective

The objective of Week 2 was to understand Python data structures and functions and apply them for data transformation and cleaning.

---

# 2️⃣ Concepts Learned

## 🔹 1. Lists

Lists are ordered and mutable collections.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(numbers[0])
```

---

## 🔹 2. Tuples

Tuples are ordered but immutable.

```python
data = (1, 2, 3)
print(data[1])
```

---

## 🔹 3. Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.

```python
student = {"name": "Snehal", "age": 21}
print(student["name"])
```

---

## 🔹 4. Sets

Sets store unique values.

```python
nums = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print(nums)
```

---

## 🔹 5. Functions

Functions help reuse code.

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name

print(greet("Snehal"))
```

---

## 🔹 6. Lambda Function

Anonymous function written in one line.

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))
```

---

## 🔹 7. Recursion

Function calling itself.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```

---

## 🔹 8. List Comprehension

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [x*x for x in numbers]
print(squares)
```

---

# 3️⃣ Hands-On Programs

### ✅ Sum of Squares

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum([x*x for x in numbers])
print("Sum of Squares:", result)
```

---

### ✅ Filtering Even Numbers

```python
numbers = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)
```

---

# 4️⃣ Client Project – Data Cleaning Script

### 📊 Project: Remove Duplicates and Filter Data

```python
data = [10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50]

# Remove duplicates
clean_data = list(set(data))

# Filter values greater than 25
filtered_data = [x for x in clean_data if x > 25]

print("Clean Data:", clean_data)
print("Filtered Data:", filtered_data)
```

---

# 5️⃣ Learning Outcome

* Understood different data structures.
* Learned how to create reusable functions.
* Applied lambda and recursion.
* Performed basic data cleaning operations.

## 🔹 2. NumPy Operations & Broadcasting

```python
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(arr1 + arr2)
```

---

## 🔹 3. Pandas Series

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30])
print(data)
```

---

## 🔹 4. Pandas DataFrame

```python
data = {
    "Name": ["A", "B", "C"],
    "Marks": [80, 85, 90]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

## 🔹 5. Indexing and Selection

print(df["Marks"])
```

---

## 🔹 6. Data Grouping

```python
df.groupby("Name").mean()
```

---

# 3️⃣ Hands-On Practice

print(df.head())
```

---

### Calculate Average

```python
print("Average Marks:", df["Marks"].mean())
```

    "Marks": [80, None, 90, 85]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Remove missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Calculate average marks
average_marks = df["Marks"].mean()

print("Cleaned Data:")
