 Week 1

1️⃣ Objective

The objective of Week 1 was to understand the fundamentals of Python programming and develop basic problem-solving skills using Python.

2️⃣ Concepts Learned
🔹 1. Variables

Variables are used to store data values in Python.
Example:

name = "Snehal"
age = 21
🔹 2. Data Types

Python supports different types of data:

Integer (int) → 10

Float → 10.5

String → "Hello"

Boolean → True / False

Example:

a = 10
b = 5.5
c = "Python"
d = True
🔹 3. Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables.

Arithmetic Operators:

(Addition)

(Subtraction)

(Multiplication)

/ (Division)

% (Modulus)

🔹 4. Input and Output

The input() function is used to take user input and print() is used to display output.

Example:

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)


🔹 5. Conditional Statements (if-else)

Used to make decisions in programs.

Example:

num = 10
if num > 5:
    print("Number is greater than 5")
else:
    print("Number is smaller")
🔹 6. Loops
For Loop

Used when the number of iterations is known.

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
While Loop

Used when the number of iterations is unknown.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


--------------------------------------------------------
 Learning Outcome

By completing Week 1:

I understood Python syntax and basic structure.

I learned how to use variables and data types.

I practiced decision-making using conditional statements.

I implemented loops for repetition.

I created simple real-world programs.

I developed a basic data processing script.

Week 1 helped me build a strong foundation in Python programming, which will be useful for data analysis and future projects.
